# Space Tanks
Loosely inspired by this 2 player tank game I played on my friend's iPhone like 10 years ago. Fight against
a friend in a battle to the death. Last tank standing wins!

## More Details
Players are on the opposite side of each other on the map, and must fire across the obstacle in order
to hit their target. You can move and shoot on your turn, and it will be to your advantage to do so. Gain money
by making hits on your target, and use this to buy upgrades.

## Controls
* P1: WA to move, S to fire salvo
* P2: LR arrows to move, down arrow to fire salvo
* Space: Fire normal shot (players alternate)
* Tab to pause / un-pause
