# Space Tanks
Loosely inspired by this 2 player tank game I played on my friend's iPhone like 10 years ago. Fight against
a friend in a battle to the death. Last tank standing wins!

## More Details
Players start on opposite sides of the map, and can move and fire at each other. Watch your health and plan your strategy
accordingly. Use power-ups when you can to assist you in your battle. Your tank also needs to reload after each shot, so
make it count!

## Controls
* P1: AD to move, S to buy powerup ($500, heals 20 HP), W to fire.
* P2: LR arrows to move, down arrow to buy powerup, up arrow to fire.
* Tab to pause / un-pause
